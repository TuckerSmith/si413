#### TASK 5 ####

semantics: |
    Language operates like a ship, using ship-esque language. 
    
    Commands will be echoed back to the user (the Conn) when processed
    
    The back_signal command returns a new, reversed signal. It does not modify the original signal.
    
    signal_less_than and signal_contains commands return a boolean (Aye/Nay).
    
    stand_by_and_await, stand_by_or_await, and stand_by_not commands return a boolean (Aye/Nay).

    Comments are denoted using log [comment], and do not span multiple lines.
