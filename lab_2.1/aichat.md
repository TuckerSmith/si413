Syntax is explained well and makes it easier to understand.

Input number 2 and output number 2 don't match up. I might be missing something on how that came about.

When you say time/distance based, is it actually calculaitng the distance somehow to know when to run certain commands?

I like the use of the 1MC and all the ship terminology, makes it seem like a fun and interesting language.

That's an excellent start to a programming language. You've established a clear theme, defined your basic syntax, and provided illustrative examples. The use of naval terminology like 1MC and lash is a creative touch that makes the language unique.

Critique of the Language Spec

Here's a breakdown of the strengths and weaknesses of your current spec:

Strengths

    Creative Naming: The use of shipboard commands like 1MC and lash is very creative and gives the language a memorable, cohesive identity.

    Clear Examples: Your example_program and example_input sections effectively demonstrate how the language should behave.

    Well-Defined Commands: The descriptions for receive, lash, back_signal, 1MC, and log are clear and easy to understand.

    Concise Literals: The 256-character limit for strings (signals) is a good design choice, enforcing the "Keep It Simple, Stupid" (KISS) principle you mentioned.

Weaknesses and Areas for Improvement

    Syntax Ambiguity: The language_syntax section is a bit inconsistent. You introduce lash<heading/"?"> and lash<"Helm, come to course "/back_signal<heading>> but your lash command definition is lash<payload1/payload2>. It's unclear what the difference is between a payload and a signal, or how a back_signal command can be nested within a lash command. This needs to be clarified to show how commands can be nested as arguments. You might need to introduce a concept like expressions or sub-commands.

    Undefined Variable Handling: The example receive<heading>! and subsequent use of heading implies that heading is a variable, but the syntax for declaring or assigning variables is not specified. How are variables created and stored? Is receive the only way to get a value into a variable?

    Input/Output Mismatch: As your reviewer noted, example_output_2 does not logically follow from example_input_2. Hellow World becomes dlroW wolleH, but the program's logic only reverses the heading string after the We need the reverse of that! line. The 470 example shows that back_signal reverses the number, but reversing Hellow World should only happen in the last line. The output Helm, come to course dlroW wolleH is correct for the logic, but the intermediate output Hellow World? followed by We need the reverse of that! suggests that the reversal is happening at the very end. The reviewer is correct in their observation; the output doesn't match the flow of the program.

    Lack of Control Flow: You have no way to handle conditional logic (if/else), loops (for/while), or functions. This makes the language extremely limited for anything but a simple, linear script.

    Unit Specification: The syntax 500 yards, 30 knots is mentioned, but its purpose is not defined. What happens with this information? Is it simply a part of a string literal, or does it trigger some kind of internal calculation? This part of the spec seems orphaned.

    Variable Scope: The receive<heading> command suggests a single global variable named heading. Does this language support multiple variables? What are their names? Can they be changed? This needs to be defined.

How to Improve Your Spec

    Clarify the Syntax for Nested Commands: Explicitly state that a command's payload can be another command that returns a value. For instance, you could say something like, "The payload of a command can be a string literal or the result of another command."

    Define Variable Declarations: Introduce a command for creating variables, perhaps set_signal<variable_name/value>!, or define that receive<variable_name> also serves as a declaration.

    Address the Mismatch: Re-examine example_output_2 and correct it so it logically follows the program flow. The output should be a direct result of the commands being executed in order. The back_signal command should only affect the final line of output.

    Consider Control Flow: For a more complete language, you could introduce simple conditional statements. For example, a if_signal_true<payload> or check<payload> command could check if a signal is empty or a specific value.

    Provide a Clearer Purpose for Units: Decide if units like knots and yards are just part of a string, or if you want to create commands that use them for calculations, such as calculate_speed<distance/time>!.

    Formalize the Rules: Your spec is a bit conversational ("the rules of punctuation are written in blood"). For a formal language specification, it would be better to state these rules more formally. For example, "Every statement must end with an exclamation mark (!)."

Your language has a lot of potential, and with some of these clarifications, it could be a very fun and functional project.

give me your suggested changes. Do not change the way I write the rules, it is intentionally conversational. I updated some of it. tell me explicityly whay youre doing. the requirements are: Your language needs to support all of the things from the previous unit:


String literals

String concatenation

String reversal

String input

String printing

When you say time/distance based, is it actually calculaitng the distance somehow to know when to run certain commands?

I like the use of the 1MC and all the ship terminology, makes it seem like a fun and interesting language.

Your updated spec is a solid starting point! I'm making changes to fix the logical inconsistencies and clarify the rules, while keeping your unique, conversational style. The main goal is to ensure the spec works as a complete set of instructions for building the language, covering all the requirements you listed.

Explicit Changes

1. Addressing the Input/Output Mismatch

    Problem: The example_program output for Hellow World is wrong. The program prints "Hellow World?", then "We need the reverse of that!", and then the final reversed string. The current output shows Hellow World? followed by We need the reverse of that!, but the final output is Helm, come to course dlroW wolleH. This suggests the reversal happens on a blank string, not Hellow World.

    Solution: I'm correcting example_output_2 to reflect the actual program flow. The output should be:

        What's our heading? Hellow World (from the first two lines)

        Hellow World? (from lash<heading/"?">!)

        We need the reverse of that! (from 1MC<"We need the reverse of that!">!)

        Helm, come to course dlroW wolleH (from the final lash command, which correctly reverses "Hellow World").

2. Clarifying Nested Commands and Variable Usage

    Problem: The spec mentions lash<"Helm, come to course "/back_signal<heading>>!, which implies that back_signal<heading> is a command that returns a value to be used as a payload for lash. However, the syntax rules don't explicitly state that commands can be nested as arguments. Also, the variable heading is used but never explicitly defined.

    Solution: I'm adding a new section to language_syntax that explicitly defines how signals (variables) are created and used. I'm also clarifying that a payload can be either a string literal or the result of a sub-command.

3. Defining receive Command and Variables

    Problem: The spec says receive reads from stdin, but the usage receive<> doesn't explain how the input is stored in a variable like heading.

    Solution: I'm updating the receive command's usage to receive<variable_name>. This clearly establishes that receive is both a declaration and an input command. I'm also adding a new rule: Any variable name must be declared with receive before it can be used.

we also need the following now: Additionally, your language must also support:


Boolean literals: Some way to specify a literal “true” or “false” value in source code

Boolean logic operations: Logical AND and OR of two boolean values, and logical NOT of a single boolean value. (And of course, these operations can be nested arbitrarily.)

String less-than: Testing whether one string comes before another one in lexicographic order, returning a boolean true/false

String contains: Testing whether one string is a (contiguous) substring of another one, returning a boolean true/false

Boolean printing: Printing out a boolean expression to standard out

Variables: Let the programmer assign a name to the result of evaluating an expression, then use that name in later expressions

Based on your updated requirements, here are the suggested changes to your ShippyLanguage specification. I'm building on the previous version, focusing on integrating Boolean literals, logic, and comparison operations while maintaining your unique, conversational style.

Explicit Changes

1. Introducing Boolean Literals

    Problem: Your language has no way to represent true or false values.

    Solution: I'm adding Aye for true and Nay for false. This fits your naval theme and gives a clear, concise way to express these values. I'll define these under a new "Boolean Literals" section.

2. Adding Boolean Operations

    Problem: There's no syntax for logical operations like AND, OR, and NOT.

    Solution: I'm introducing three new commands: stand_by_and_await, stand_by_or_await, and stand_by_not. These are designed to take boolean expressions as payloads and return a boolean value. This maintains the command-based syntax command<payload>!.

3. Adding String Comparison and Substring Operations

    Problem: You need a way to compare strings lexicographically and check for a substring.

    Solution: I'm introducing signal_less_than and signal_contains. These commands will take two string payloads and return a boolean value, aligning with your new boolean system.

4. Defining Boolean Printing

    Problem: You need to print a boolean result, but the 1MC command is currently defined only for strings.

    Solution: I'm updating the 1MC command's description to state that it can also print boolean values. This is a simple but crucial change to complete the boolean functionality. The output for Aye and Nay will be those words themselves.

5. Clarifying Variable Usage and Assignment

    Problem: The spec mentions variables but doesn't clearly show how a variable can store the result of an expression (like a boolean operation).

    Solution: I'm updating the variable rules to clarify that variables can hold any type of value, and that an explicit assign command is needed to give a variable a value from an expression. This separates the act of creating a variable (receive) from giving it a new value (assign), making the language more robust. I've also added a new assign command.

does this address creating a boolean variable?

No, your spec does not fully address creating a boolean variable. While it introduces boolean literals (Aye and Nay) and operations, it doesn't provide a clear mechanism for declaring a new variable specifically to hold a boolean value from the result of an expression.

Critique and Suggested Changes

Your current spec allows you to assign a boolean value to an already existing variable (e.g., assign<my_signal/stand_by_not<"Aye">>), but it doesn't show how a new, empty variable is declared to hold that value in the first place. The receive command is only for string input from the user.

To fix this, you should update the spec to clearly define a command for variable declaration that is not tied to user input.

Here's how you can update your spec to address this:

1. Modify the receive Command

Make receive the universal variable declaration command. It will create a new variable, whether it's for string input or an expression's result.

    Current Usage: receive<variable_name>

    Suggested Change: receive creates a new variable. It can be used with a command that returns a value.

        New Usage: receive<variable_name/value> or receive<variable_name/sub_command>. This would make the assign command redundant for initial declaration. For instance, receive<my_boolean/stand_by_and_await<"Aye"/"Nay">>! would declare my_boolean and set its value.

2. Introduce a Separate declare Command

Alternatively, you could add a new command, declare, specifically for creating new variables. This keeps receive dedicated to user input.

    New Command: declare

    Usage: declare<variable_name>

    Explanation: This command creates an empty variable. The assign command is then used to give it a value. This two-step process (declare then assign) is a common pattern in many languages and would make your spec very clear.

I recommend the second approach. It makes the purpose of each command distinct and easy to understand, while still fitting within your existing syntax. This addresses the core issue of how to create a new variable to hold the result of a boolean operation.

lets do declare

Alright, let's get that declare command in there. This is a great change because it makes your variable handling much more explicit and clean.

Explicit Changes

1. Introducing the declare Command

    Problem: Your language had no way to create a new variable to hold the result of an expression, like a boolean operation, without first using receive (which is for user input).

    Solution: I'm adding a new command called declare. Its purpose is simple: to create a new signal (variable) that doesn't have a value yet. This keeps receive focused on user input and gives you a clear way to create variables for other purposes.

2. Clarifying the Variable Workflow

    Problem: The relationship between creating a variable and assigning it a value was a bit murky.

    Solution: I've updated the Variables section to explicitly state the new two-step process. You'll now use declare<variable_name>! to create the signal, and then assign<variable_name/new_value>! to give it a value. This is a standard and robust way to handle variables.

        Strings, referred to as signals, will be expressed using quotation marks. Limited to 256 characters due to the KISS design principle. If you have more to say, keep it to yourself.

    Boolean Literals:
        "Aye" and "Nay" are the only boolean literals. Aye means true, Nay means false.

    Payloads: Payloads are command arguments. Payloads can be a string literal, a boolean literal, or the result of a sub-command.
    
    
    Commands: Commands will be expressed in the format "command<payload1/payload2>"
        
        receive - read from stdin and assign the input to a new signal (variable).
            usage: receive<variable_name>
        
        declare - create a new signal (variable) without assigning a value.
            usage: declare<variable_name>
        
        assign - assign a new value to an existing signal.
            usage: assign<variable_name/new_value>
        
        lash - concatenate two signals (strings).
            usage: lash<signal1/signal2>
            
        back_signal - reverse a signal (string).
            usage: back_signal<signal>

        signal_less_than - check if signal1 is lexicographically less than signal2.
            usage: signal_less_than<signal1/signal2>
        
        signal_contains - check if signal1 is a substring of signal2.
            usage: signal_contains<signal1/signal2>
            
        stand_by_and_await - perform a logical AND operation.
            usage: stand_by_and_await<boolean1/boolean2>
            
        stand_by_or_await - perform a logical OR operation.
            usage: stand_by_or_await<boolean1/boolean2>
            
        stand_by_not - perform a logical NOT operation.
            usage: stand_by_not<boolean>
        
        1MC - print to stdout. Can print signals (strings) or booleans.
            usage: 1MC<[signal]> or 1MC<[boolean]>
            
        log - add a comment. The Conn doesn't need to know everything.
            usage: log (insert comment here, read until '!')
        
    Some arguments may precede their respective commands.
        [Command] [argument]!
            or
        [Argument] [command]!
        
    If command has multiple parts, delineate with a ';'
        ex. Right standard rudder; come to course 070!
        
    The first letter of the declaration or statement must be capitalized because standards matter and the rules of punctuation are written in blood.
    
    Variables:
        Variables are referred to as signals. You must first create a new signal using the declare command. For example, declare<my_boolean>! will create a signal named "my_boolean". A signal can hold any type of value. The assign command is used to set a value for a signal after it has been declared. The receive command is a special case for declaring a signal with user input.

        
language_semantics: |
    Language operates like a ship, using ship-esque language. 
    
    Commands will be echoed back to the user (the Conn) when processed
    
    The back_signal command returns a new, reversed signal. It does not modify the original signal.
    
    signal_less_than and signal_contains commands return a boolean (Aye/Nay).
    
    stand_by_and_await, stand_by_or_await, and stand_by_not commands return a boolean (Aye/Nay).

    Syntax is explained well and makes it easier to understand.
    Input number 2 and output number 2 don't match up. I might be missing something on how that came about.
    When you say time/distance based, is it actually calculaitng the distance somehow to know when to run certain commands?
    I like the use of the 1MC and all the ship terminology, makes it seem like a fun and interesting language.

Write an example program and test cases demonstrating how your

language works.

ShippyLanguage Example Program

Here is an example program that shows off a little more of what ShippyLanguage can do, including boolean variables and operations, along with some string manipulation.

example_program: |
    1MC<"Secure a watch, what's the password?">!
    receive<watch_pass>!   log Getting the conn's password!

    declare<auth_status>!   log Creating a variable to hold our boolean result!

    assign<auth_status/stand_by_and_await<signal_contains<watch_pass/"starboard">/stand_by_not<signal_less_than<watch_pass/"Zulu">>>>!
    log The password must contain "starboard" and not come lexicographically before "Zulu"!

    1MC<"Security status: "/auth_status>!
    log Report the auth status to the bridge!

    1MC<"We need to log this password reversal in the logbook:">!
    1MC<back_signal<watch_pass>>!

Test Case 1: Successful Authentication

This test case uses a password that meets the security criteria, resulting in a successful authentication and a final status of Aye.

Example Input 1

starboard_anchor

Example Output 1

Secure a watch, what's the password? starboard_anchor
Security status: Aye
We need to log this password reversal in the logbook:
rohcna_draobrats

Test Case 2: Failed Authentication

This test case uses a password that fails the security criteria, resulting in a failed authentication and a final status of Nay.

Example Input 2

port_bow

Example Output 2

Secure a watch, what's the password? port_bow
Security status: Nay
We need to log this password reversal in the logbook:
wob_trop

now i need to create a token specification list

Token Specification for ShippyLanguage

Here is a list of the tokens required to parse the ShippyLanguage. Each token is defined by its type and a regular expression or description that a lexer would use to identify it.

    Commands: These are the keywords that initiate an action.

        1MC

        receive

        declare

        assign

        lash

        back_signal

        signal_less_than

        signal_contains

        stand_by_and_await

        stand_by_or_await

        stand_by_not

        log

    Literals: These represent fixed values in the source code.

        STRING_LITERAL: A sequence of characters enclosed in double quotes.

            Regex: "[^"]*"

        BOOLEAN_LITERAL: The fixed values for true and false.

            Regex: Aye|Nay

    Delimiters: These characters structure the command syntax.

        COMMAND_START: The < character, which marks the beginning of a command's payload.

        COMMAND_END: The > character, which marks the end of a command's payload.

        ARGUMENT_SEPARATOR: The / character, used to separate multiple payloads within a command.

        STATEMENT_END: The ! character, which terminates a complete command or statement.

        MULTI_COMMAND_SEPARATOR: The ; character, used to separate multiple commands on a single line.

    Identifiers: These are names for variables.

        IDENTIFIER: A sequence of alphanumeric characters (including underscores) that is not a reserved command or literal. According to the syntax rules, the first letter must be capitalized.

            Regex: [a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*

            Note: The example programs use heading, watch_pass, and auth_status, which do not follow the capitalization rule. The tokenizer should likely allow for this, but the parser may need to enforce the rule.

    Ignored Tokens: These are used to separate other tokens but are discarded by the lexer.

        WHITESPACE: Spaces, tabs, and newlines.

            Regex: \s+

        COMMENT: The text following a log command up to the next !. This is a special case and is often handled by a custom rule to ignore the entire log content.

so in a concise format

To provide a concise token specification, I'll organize the information into a clear list. I will streamline the descriptions to be as direct as possible, using the terms you've established.

ShippyLanguage Token Specification

Here is a concise list of tokens for the ShippyLanguage.

    Commands: 1MC, receive, declare, assign, lash, back_signal, signal_less_than, signal_contains, stand_by_and_await, stand_by_or_await, stand_by_not, log.

    Literals:

        String: A sequence of characters enclosed in " ".

        Boolean: Aye or Nay.

    Identifiers: Alphanumeric names used for signals (variables), e.g., heading, watch_pass.

    Punctuation:

        <: Command payload start.

        >: Command payload end.

        /: Payload separator.

        !: Statement terminator.

        ;: Multi-command separator.

    Whitespace: Spaces, newlines, and tabs. These separate tokens and are ignored.

    Comments: Content following the log command until the next !. This text is ignored by the compiler.

Write a context-free grammar using those token types

to formally specify your langauge’s syntax.

A context-free grammar (CFG) formally defines the syntax of a language by specifying how its tokens can be combined to form valid programs. Using the token types from the previous response, here is a CFG for ShippyLanguage.

Grammar Notation

    Non-terminals: Syntactic categories like <Program> are enclosed in angle brackets.

    Terminals: The token types (e.g., 1MC, STRING_LITERAL, !) are in all caps.

    ->: Separates the non-terminal from its possible expansions.

    |: Separates alternative expansions for a single non-terminal.

    empty: Represents an empty string, meaning the production can resolve to nothing.

ShippyLanguage CFG

$1. \quad \

$2. \quad \

$3. \quad \

$4. \quad \

$5. \quad \
 (The <CommentContent> is any sequence of characters that does not contain a STATEMENT_END token.)

$6. \quad \

$7. \quad \

$8. \quad \

$9. \quad \

$10. \quad \

$11. \quad \

fix your answer

The context-free grammar is fundamentally correct, but it can be presented more concisely and with a direct clarification about an ambiguity in the original language specification. The grammar below has been refined to be more readable and accurately reflects the syntax used in the provided example programs.

Context-Free Grammar for ShippyLanguage

This grammar uses the previously defined token types to specify valid programs.

I want you to explain each concept in a single paragraph, in an understandable way to a student who is learning about compilers for the first time. The explanations must be short but detailed enough to convey the main idea.
Please ensure your explanations are clear and easy to follow. Use simple examples or analogies to help me understand each concept better. The tone should be similar to a lecture.
I am particularly interested in the role of each stage in the overall compilation process and how they relate to one another. So, please emphasize the connections between these phases.

Language Semantics

Semantics defines the meaning of a program, determining what each command actually does. For ShippyLanguage, the commands operate on a data store of signals, which are the variables you've declared. The execution of a program is a sequential process, where each command is processed in the order it appears, like following a checklist on the bridge.

    1MC: This command acts as the ship's public address system. It takes a single payload—either a string signal or a boolean literal—and prints its value directly to the standard output, which is the user's screen. For example, 1MC<"Secure from watch,">! would print "Secure from watch,".

    receive: This command is how the ship receives orders from an outside source. It pauses execution, waits for a line of text from standard input, and then assigns that entire line as a string value to the specified variable name. This command is a special case of a variable assignment that ties the value directly to user input.

    declare: A signal is brought into existence with this command. It creates a new variable in the program's memory with the given name but without an initial value. Think of it as reserving a spot on a manifest for a new crew member; you've made a space for them, but they haven't reported aboard yet.

    assign: This is how you give a variable its marching orders. It takes a variable name and a new value—which can be a literal or the result of a sub-command—and stores that new value in the variable, overwriting any previous value.

    lash: As in lashing two lines together, this command concatenates two string signals. It returns a new string which is the first string followed immediately by the second. The original signals are not modified.

    back_signal: This command inverts a signal. It takes a single string and returns a new string with the characters in reverse order. This is a common drill to ensure watchstanders can follow orders that seem backwards. It does not alter the original signal's value.

    signal_less_than: This comparison command determines which of two signals comes first alphabetically. It takes two string signals and returns a boolean value: Aye if the first signal is lexicographically less than the second, and Nay otherwise.

    signal_contains: This command checks for a substring within a larger string. It takes two string signals and returns Aye if the second signal is found as a contiguous part of the first, and Nay if it is not.

    stand_by_and_await: Like two orders that must both be completed before you can proceed, this command performs a logical AND operation. It takes two boolean signals and returns Aye only if both are Aye; otherwise, it returns Nay.

    stand_by_or_await: This command performs a logical OR operation. It takes two boolean signals and returns Nay only if both are Nay; otherwise, it returns Aye.

    stand_by_not: As in "stand by to not drop the anchor," this command inverts a single boolean value. It returns Aye if the input is Nay, and Nay if the input is Aye.

    log: This command is for record-keeping. It is a source code comment that is ignored during program execution; it does not perform any operation.

provide what i should put in language_semantics

I can help with that. Based on the language specification you've provided, here's a detailed and clear description of its semantics, or what the commands actually mean and do. I'll use your naval theme to keep the language consistent.

Language Semantics

The language operates like a ship following a plan of the day, with commands being executed sequentially. The "Conn," or user, observes the output as each command is processed. The program's state is maintained through a set of signals (variables) in a central storage, which can be manipulated by commands.

Execution Flow:
The program processes commands one by one, in the order they are written. When a command is executed, it's "echoed back" to the Conn, making the process transparent. This is crucial for debugging and understanding the program's progress.

Data and Variables:

    Signals are the central data unit, representing either a string or a boolean value.

    The declare<variable_name>! command reserves a new signal in memory. It's like adding an entry to a crew roster without assigning a sailor to it yet.

    The receive<variable_name>! command is a special case of declaration and assignment. It creates a new signal and immediately assigns it a string value taken directly from standard input.

    The assign<variable_name/new_value>! command updates an existing signal's value. The new_value can be a literal or the result of a sub-command.

Command Semantics:

    1MC: This command acts as the ship's public address system. It takes one payload and prints its value to standard output. It's the primary way for the program to communicate with the user.

    lash: This command combines two string signals into a single new string. It's like tying two ropes together; the original ropes remain unchanged. The command returns this new, concatenated string.

    back_signal: This command reverses the order of characters in a string signal. It returns a new, reversed signal and does not modify the original signal.

    signal_less_than and signal_contains: These are comparison commands. They take two string signals, perform a test, and return a boolean signal (Aye or Nay) as the result.

    stand_by_and_await, stand_by_or_await, stand_by_not: These commands perform logical operations on boolean signals. They return a new boolean signal (Aye or Nay) based on the rules of logical AND, OR, and NOT, respectively.

    log: This command is for internal record-keeping. It is treated as a source code comment and has no effect on program execution. It's ignored by the interpreter or compiler.

this is what the token specification list should look like: # there are just two example tokens below; you should remove or modify them!!

Literals: 
    Strings, referred to as signals, will be expressed using quotation marks. Limited to 256 characters due to the KISS design principle. If you have more to say, keep it to yourself.

Payloads: Payloads are command arguments


Commands: Commands will be expressed in the format "command<payload1/payload2>"
    
    receive - read from stdin
        usage: receive<>
    
    lash - concatenate two signals(strings)
        usage: lash<payload1/payload2>

    [Argument] [command]!
    
If command has multiple parts, delineate with a ';'
    ex. Right standard rudder; come to course 070!
    
The first letter of the declaration or statement must be capitalized because standards matter and the rules of punctuation are written in blood.

Units are specified after values:

Task 4

reviewer_for: Tucker Smith

reviewed_by: Austin Benigni

review_passed: Y

reviewer_comments: <
Syntax is explained well and makes it easier to understand.
Input number 2 and output number 2 don't match up. I might be missing something on how that came about.
When you say time/distance based, is it actually calculaitng the distance somehow to know when to run certain commands?
I like the use of the 1MC and all the ship terminology, makes it seem like a fun and interesting language.

Assistant: That's an excellent start to a programming language. You've established a clear theme, defined your basic syntax, and provided illustrative examples. The use of naval terminology like 1MC and lash is a creative touch that makes the language unique.

Critique of the Language Spec

Here's a breakdown of the strengths and weaknesses of your current spec:

Strengths

    Creative Naming: The use of shipboard commands like 1MC and lash is very creative and gives the language a memorable, cohesive identity.

    Clear Examples: Your example_program and example_input sections effectively demonstrate how the language should behave.

    Well-Defined Commands: The descriptions for receive, lash, back_signal, 1MC, and log are clear and easy to understand.

    Concise Literals: The 256-character limit for strings (signals) is a good design choice, enforcing the "Keep It Simple, Stupid" (KISS) principle you mentioned.

Weaknesses and Areas for Improvement

    Syntax Ambiguity: The language_syntax section is a bit inconsistent. You introduce lash<heading/"?"> and lash<"Helm, come to course "/back_signal<heading>> but your lash command definition is lash<payload1/payload2>. It's unclear what the difference is between a payload and a signal, or how a back_signal command can be nested within a lash command. This needs to be clarified to show how commands can be nested as arguments. You might need to introduce a concept like expressions or sub-commands.

    Undefined Variable Handling: The example receive<heading>! and subsequent use of heading implies that heading is a variable, but the syntax for declaring or assigning variables is not specified. How are variables created and stored? Is receive the only way to get a value into a variable?

    Input/Output Mismatch: As your reviewer noted, example_output_2 does not logically follow from example_input_2. Hellow World becomes dlroW wolleH, but the program's logic only reverses the heading string after the We need the reverse of that! line. The 470 example shows that back_signal reverses the number, but reversing Hellow World should only happen in the last line. The output Helm, come to course dlroW wolleH is correct for the logic, but the intermediate output Hellow World? followed by We need the reverse of that! suggests that the reversal is happening at the very end. The reviewer is correct in their observation; the output doesn't match the flow of the program.

    Lack of Control Flow: You have no way to handle conditional logic (if/else), loops (for/while), or functions. This makes the language extremely limited for anything but a simple, linear script.

    Unit Specification: The syntax 500 yards, 30 knots is mentioned, but its purpose is not defined. What happens with this information? Is it simply a part of a string literal, or does it trigger some kind of internal calculation? This part of the spec seems orphaned.

    Variable Scope: The receive<heading> command suggests a single global variable named heading. Does this language support multiple variables? What are their names? Can they be changed? This needs to be defined.

How to Improve Your Spec

    Clarify the Syntax for Nested Commands: Explicitly state that a command's payload can be another command that returns a value. For instance, you could say something like, "The payload of a command can be a string literal or the result of another command."

    Define Variable Declarations: Introduce a command for creating variables, perhaps set_signal<variable_name/value>!, or define that receive<variable_name> also serves as a declaration.

    Address the Mismatch: Re-examine example_output_2 and correct it so it logically follows the program flow. The output should be a direct result of the commands being executed in order. The back_signal command should only affect the final line of output.

    Consider Control Flow: For a more complete language, you could introduce simple conditional statements. For example, a if_signal_true<payload> or check<payload> command could check if a signal is empty or a specific value.

    Provide a Clearer Purpose for Units: Decide if units like knots and yards are just part of a string, or if you want to create commands that use them for calculations, such as calculate_speed<distance/time>!.

    Formalize the Rules: Your spec is a bit conversational ("the rules of punctuation are written in blood"). For a formal language specification, it would be better to state these rules more formally. For example, "Every statement must end with an exclamation mark (!)."

Your language has a lot of potential, and with some of these clarifications, it could be a very fun and functional project.

User: give me your suggested changes. Do not change the way I write the rules, it is intentionally conversational. I updated some of it. tell me explicityly whay youre doing. the requirements are: Your language needs to support all of the things from the previous unit:

String literals
String concatenation
String reversal
String input
String printing
