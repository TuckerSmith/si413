# explain a little what inspired your language and why it's cool
language_explanation: |
    My language uses a mix of ASCII art and R-like syntax, hence 
    the super clever name. It combines two of my favorite things!
    Functions are first-class, functions will take 0 to many arguments,
    lambda functions are supported, typing is dynamic, variable 
    variables will use lexical scoping, and functions do not need to
    return a value.

# this is the example program that you make up
example_program: |
    //\\ Global function to format and reverse a name.
    //\\ It takes one argument: 'input_name'
    
    // Define a function that reverses a string
    rev_name ===> :^) (s) [
        return ===> <--- (s)
    ]
    
    // Define a function that adds a greeting and concatenates the pieces
    format_greeting ===> :^) (name) [
        greeting ===> (Hello, )
        punc ===> (!!!)
        
        return ===> greeting &><& name &><& punc
    ]
    
    // Main execution block:
    [ o ] ((Enter your name (e.g., Alice):))
    user_input ===> -><- name_var
    
    // Process the input using the pipe (|o|)
    final_output ===> name_var |o| rev_name |o| format_greeting
    
    [ o ] (final_output)

example_input_1: |
    B O B

example_output_1: |
    Enter your name (e.g., Alice):
    Hello, B O B!!!

example_input_2: |
    susan

example_output_2: |
    Enter your name (e.g., Alice):
    Hello, nasus!!!
