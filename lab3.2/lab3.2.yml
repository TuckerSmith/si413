    - I spent a few hours trying to fix some errors that I
    made in the last lab (I changed Expr.Java). As a result,
    I did not make much headway on lab3.2 proper. Currently,
    I get a clang/lli error when trying to execute the output
    of my compiler on my small example.

    - Minor note: I also switched the logical order of contains,
    in order to avoid making changes to the original Expr.java.

# feel free to copy these example programs and inputs/outputs
# from the previous lab

    @ 1. Check for negative phrase ("ok") and assign the boolean result to is_sad
    @ [ok] ? msg returns 1 (True) if "ok" is found.
    is_sad ! [ok] ? msg

    @ 2. Check for positive phrase ("later")
    is_later ! [later] ? msg

    @ 3. Conditional Logic: Vibe Check Passes if NOT sad AND they want to hang later
    @ Condition: nt is is_sad & is is_later
    gvn nt ! is is_sad ! & is is_later !
