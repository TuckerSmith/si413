    - I spent a few hours trying to fix some errors that I
    made in the last lab (I changed Expr.Java). As a result,
    I did not make much headway on lab3.2 proper. Currently,
    I get a clang/lli error when trying to execute the output
    of my compiler on my small example.

    - Minor note: I also switched the logical order of contains,
    in order to avoid making changes to the original Expr.java.
