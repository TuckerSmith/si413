# 1. Global Variable (Lexical Scope Test)
gravy -> "Yummy " <- gravy

# 2. Function Definition (Declaration Test)

# 3. Execution

# Call the function (Function Call Test)
# Call 1 (Statement call - return value is ignored)
feast ("Turkey 1KG")

# Call 2 (Expression call - return value is used)
result -> feast ("Turkey 5KG") <- result

# Print the returned result
bawk "Returned result: " + result bawk
