used_ai: Y # remember to turn in an aichat.md file as well

# leave this as NONE for your initial submission
changes_on_resubmit: |
    - txtlng syntax was cleaned up to avoid ambiguities
    - Successfully implemented while loops and boolean operations!
    - Boolean and string operations implemented
    - dance_program now works in txtlng
# describe any collaboration or help you got from classmates
collaboration: |
    NONE

# come up with an original name for your new langauge
language_name: txtlng

# explain a little what inspired your language and why it's cool
language_explanation: |
    My language was inspired by the simplicity of truffle.
    What truffle was missing was conditional statements!
    In addition, it was not exciting enough. My language
    uses ! (YAY) instead of ~, and the simplified symbols
    have been replaced with more verbose text-speak.

# this is the example program that you make up

    chat [VIBE CHECKER: What's the latest text from your friend?]
    msg ! in
    chat [Vibe checking the message: ] + msg

    @ 1. Check for negative phrase ("ok") and assign the boolean result to is_sad
    @ [ok] ? msg returns 1 (True) if "ok" is found.
    is_sad ! [ok] ? msg

    @ 2. Check for positive phrase ("later")
    is_later ! [later] ? msg

    @ 3. Conditional Logic: Vibe Check Passes if NOT sad AND they want to hang later
    @ Condition: nt is is_sad & is is_later
    gvn nt ! is is_sad ! & is is_later !

# something else your instructor should know?
any_other_comments_for_me: |
    This assignment was pretty difficult and involved
    a lot of debugging and long conversations with Gemini!
    At the same time, I feel that I am learning a lot
    about how languages are parsed.
