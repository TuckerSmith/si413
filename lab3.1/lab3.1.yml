# explain a little what inspired your language and why it's cool
language_explanation: |
    My language was inspired by the simplicity of truffle.
    What truffle was missing was conditional statements!
    In addition, it was not exciting enough. My language
    uses ! (YAY) instead of ~, and the simplified symbols
    have been replaced with more verbose text-speak.
