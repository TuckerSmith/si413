@ 1. Check for negative phrase ("ok") and assign the boolean result to is_sad
@ [ok] ? msg returns 1 (True) if "ok" is found.
is_sad ! [ok] ? msg

@ 2. Check for positive phrase ("later")
is_later ! [later] ? msg

@ 3. Conditional Logic: Vibe Check Passes if NOT sad AND they want to hang later
@ Condition: nt is is_sad & is is_later
gvn nt ! is is_sad ! & is is_later !
