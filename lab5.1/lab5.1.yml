    steps:
    - added builtin in Value.java
    - defined builtins in Builtins.java, including helper to get strings from args
    - adding builtin functinos to global frame in Interpreter.java 
    - evalFuncCall first looks to see if function is a builtin in Interpreter.java 
    - changed Bool.toString to use True/False instead of Cooked/Uncooked

    This program is only for the "numbers"
    option (B), so just leave it here exactly
    like this and it will be ignored when
    you submit.
