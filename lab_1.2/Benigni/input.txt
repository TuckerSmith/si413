shhh This is a simple program in the DRAMA QUEEN language shhh
shhh HEAR_YE() serves as a call to print the enclosed expression shhh
HEAR_YE(~ I am a DRAMATIC LANGUAGE ~)    

HEAR_YE(REVERTERE(GIVE_ME))             shhh GIVE_ME takes a single line of text from the console as a string. REVERTERE reverses a string given to it shhh

shhh In order to concatenate strings you use the UNIFY operator as shown below
HEAR_YE(~ I will be as DRAMATIC~ UNIFY ~ ~ UNIFY ~as I WANT ~)

shhh Should you like to print a ~, all you have to do is join any combination of capital letters to the opening tilde as well as the ending tilde. 
shhh Now any tilde on the inside can be printed shhh
HEAR_YE(~APPLE I'd like to print a ~ thank you very much. ~APPLE)
