# Task 1

language_name: DRAMAQUEEN


# Task 2

example_program: |
    shhh This is a simple program in the DRAMA QUEEN language shhh
    shhh HEAR_YE() serves as a call to print the enclosed expression shhh
    HEAR_YE(~ I am a DRAMATIC LANGUAGE ~)    

    HEAR_YE(REVERTERE(GIVE_ME))             shhh GIVE_ME takes a single line of text from the console as a string. REVERTERE reverses a string given to it shhh

    shhh In order to concatenate strings you use the UNIFY operator as shown below
    HEAR_YE(~ I will be as DRAMATIC~ UNIFY ~ ~ UNIFY ~as I WANT ~)

    shhh Should you like to print a ~, all you have to do is join any combination of capital letters to the opening tilde as well as the ending tilde. 
    shhh Now any tilde on the inside can be printed shhh
    HEAR_YE(~APPLE I'd like to print a ~ thank you very much. ~APPLE)

reviewer_comments: <
    * HEAR_YE works!
    * shhh works!
    * UNIFY works!
    * REVERTERE works!

    * The full test cases doesn't work. I think 
    it is a problem with the UNIFY line. Fix that 
    and it's perfect.
    
    * Good work!
