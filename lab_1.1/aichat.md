User: what is the standard command to come to speed 20 knots and maintain it on a USN ship

Response: In the U.S. Navy, the standard command to come to a speed of 20 knots and maintain it would be given by the Conning Officer to the Lee Helmsman (the Sailor at the throttles, or propulsion controls). The specific phrasing can vary slightly depending on the ship class and its propulsion system, but a common format is:

"All engines ahead, standard, indicate 20 knots."

Here's a breakdown of the command and the standard responses:

"All engines ahead": This specifies the propulsion plants to be engaged. On many ships, this would be "All engines," "All shafts," or a similar phrase, indicating that all available propulsion is to be used.

"Standard": This is a speed bell or "engine order" that indicates a normal cruising speed. While it doesn't specify a precise speed, it sets the stage for the next part of the command.

"Indicate 20 knots": This is the specific instruction for the desired speed. The Lee Helmsman is expected to use the engine controls to bring the ship to a speed of 20 knots and then maintain that speed.

The standard response sequence is crucial for ensuring the command is heard and executed correctly.

Conning Officer: "All engines ahead, standard, indicate 20 knots."

Lee Helmsman: "All engines ahead, standard, indicate 20 knots, aye, Sir/Ma'am." (This repeats the command back to the Conning Officer to confirm it was heard and understood.)

Lee Helmsman: (After executing the command and reaching the desired speed) "Engines ahead, indicating 20 knots, Sir/Ma'am."

Conning Officer: "Very well."

The Lee Helmsman's role is to make the necessary adjustments to the ship's propulsion plant to achieve and hold the ordered speed, while the Conning Officer's role is to ensure the command is correctly executed and that the ship is maneuvering as intended.

User: what are the parts of a programming language syntax? IE if i say int x =1, int specifies the type, x is the variable name, and 1 is the value. what are the parts of something like echo "hello" > file.txt?

Response: Programming languages and shell commands have different syntactical components, though they share the goal of giving instructions to a computer.

Programming Language Syntax
In a general-purpose programming language (like C++, Python, or Java), syntax defines how you write and structure code. The parts you mentioned—int, x, and 1—are all specific types of tokens, which are the fundamental building blocks of the language.

Keywords: These are reserved words that have a special meaning to the compiler or interpreter. They can't be used for anything else. In your example, int is a keyword that specifies a data type.

Identifiers: These are names that you create to represent things in your code. They are used for variables, functions, classes, and other program elements. In your example, x is an identifier for a variable.

Operators: These are symbols or words that perform operations on values. The equals sign (=) is an assignment operator. Other examples include arithmetic operators like + and -, or comparison operators like ==.

Literals: These are fixed values that are used directly in the code. They are not the result of a calculation. In your example, 1 is a numeric literal. "hello" is a string literal.

Punctuation/Delimiters: These are characters that separate or group different parts of the code. The semicolon (;) at the end of int x = 1; is a statement terminator.

A valid combination of these components, following the language's grammar rules, forms a statement or expression. Your example, int x = 1;, is a complete declaration and assignment statement.

Shell Command Syntax
Shell commands, like those used in Bash or other command-line interpreters, have a different structure. Instead of declaring a variable, you are typically executing a program or a built-in command with specific arguments and handling its input and output. Let's break down echo "hello" > file.txt.

Command: This is the name of the program or built-in shell function to be executed. In this case, echo is the command, which prints its arguments to the standard output.

Argument: This is a value that is passed to the command. It provides additional information for the command to operate on.  "hello" is an argument that tells the echo command what text to print.

Operator: Shells use special characters as operators to perform operations on commands and files. The greater-than sign (>) is a redirection operator. It changes where the command's output goes.

Operand: This is the entity that the operator acts upon. In this command, file.txt is the operand for the redirection operator. It specifies the destination file for the output.

User: how would I specify that I want an action to be completed at a after moving a certain distance along the course, as a command on the bridge

Response: As a Conning Officer on a U.S. Navy ship, you would use a command that combines a heading with a distance and a specific action. The structure of the command depends on the action you want completed.

Changing Course
To change the ship's course after traveling a certain distance, you would say:

"Helmsman, right full rudder, come to course [new course] when we are 500 yards past the buoy."

Helmsman: Specifies the person to receive the command.

right full rudder, come to course [new course]: The action to be completed.

when we are 500 yards past the buoy: Specifies the distance and reference point for the action.

Dropping Anchor
To drop anchor at a specified distance from a navigational point, you would say:

"Stand by the anchor. Drop the starboard anchor at 1,000 yards from the sea buoy."

Stand by the anchor: An initial command to the anchor detail to get ready.

Drop the starboard anchor: The specific action to be completed.

at 1,000 yards from the sea buoy: Specifies the distance and reference point for the action.

General Action
For any other action, the general format is:

"[Action to be completed] when we are [distance] from [reference point]."

The command must be clear and direct, with a specific reference point and distance to ensure the action is executed precisely as intended.

User: how to ask to take a fix on a navaid

Response: To ask for a fix on a navaid (navigational aid), a Conning Officer on a U.S. Navy ship would use a command directed at the Navigator or Quartermaster of the Watch. The standard command is a clear and direct request for a position update based on the specified navaid.

Taking a Visual Fix
To take a fix using a visual navaid, such as a buoy, light, or landmark, the command is:

"Navigator, give me a fix on [name of the navaid]."

Navigator: Specifies the person who is to take the fix and plot it.

give me a fix: The direct request for a new position plot.

on [name of the navaid]: Specifies the visual reference point to be used. The name should be clear, such as "buoy number two," "Smith's Island lighthouse," or "the red bell buoy."

Taking a Radar Fix
To take a fix using radar, the command would be:

"Navigator, take a radar fix."

This is typically followed by details about the objects to be used, such as "on the two sea buoys and the headland." The Navigator then uses the ship's radar to measure the range and bearing to these objects and plots the ship's position.

Upon hearing the command, the Navigator will acknowledge it and then use the appropriate equipment (e.g., a bearing circle, alidade, or radar) to get the required measurements. They will then plot the position on the chart and report back to the Conning Officer. A typical response would be:

"Fix is plotted, ship is at [latitude and longitude] or [distance] from [reference point]."

User: how would the nav return the bearing and range of the object

Response: When the Conning Officer asks for a fix on a navaid, the Navigator or Quartermaster of the Watch will measure and report the bearing and range of the object. The standard format for this report is to state the object first, followed by its bearing and range.

The report would be:

"Stand by for the fix... [Name of the object], bearing [number] degrees true, range [number] yards/miles."

Components of the Report
"Stand by for the fix": This is an optional but common preparatory phrase that alerts the Conning Officer and others on the bridge that the information is about to be reported.

[Name of the object]: The name of the navaid or landmark used for the measurement. Clarity is key. For example, "the lighthouse on the point" or "the red buoy."

Bearing: This is the direction of the object from the ship, measured in degrees from true north. The measurement is always stated in three digits (e.g., "090 degrees true," not "90 degrees true"). It's crucial to specify true bearing to distinguish it from magnetic bearing, which is not used for navigation fixes on a ship's chart.

Range: This is the distance to the object, typically measured in yards or nautical miles.

"Fix is plotted": After reporting the individual measurements, the Navigator will say this to confirm that the ship's position has been accurately marked on the chart.

Example Exchange
Here is a typical exchange on the bridge:

Conning Officer: "Navigator, give me a fix on the lighthouse."

Navigator: (after taking the measurements) "The lighthouse, bearing 035 degrees true, range 3,500 yards. Fix is plotted."

Conning Officer: "Very well."

User: i'm making a programming language that uses nautical terms, which is why im asking

Response: That's an excellent and creative idea! Nautical terms are rich with specific, action-oriented vocabulary that can be adapted for programming syntax. Here's a breakdown of the parts of programming language syntax and how you can translate them into your nautical-themed language.

1. Basic Components of Syntax
A programming language's syntax is made up of a few key components. For each, here's how you could give them a nautical flair:

Keywords: These are reserved words that have a special meaning. In your language, you could use nautical commands.

if could be if sea or if clear_channel.

while could be while underway or while making_way.

function could be lay_out_course or plot.

return could be make_port or secure.

Identifiers: These are the names you give to variables, functions, and other parts of your code. You can use terms for specific parts of a ship or crew roles.

Instead of x, you could use bearing or velocity.

Instead of my_list, you could use cargo_hold or flotilla.

Instead of calculate_average, you could use calculate_trim.

Operators: These are symbols that perform operations. You can get creative with these.

+ (addition) could be + (since it's universal) or you could create a keyword like add_to.

= (assignment) could be set_course or take_on_load. For example, set_course velocity to 20 knots.

== (comparison) could be is_on_course or is_shipshape.

Literals: These are fixed values.

Numbers can be referred to as knots (for integers), fathoms (for decimals), or bearing (for a specific number).

Strings ("hello") could be called hails or signals.

2. Putting it all together
Let's look at how these nautical terms can form more complex commands and structures.

Variable Declaration/Assignment:

int my_knots = 10; could become knots my_knots = 10.

string my_hail = "Ahoy, Matey!"; could become hail my_hail = "Ahoy, Matey!".

Conditional Statements:

if (wind_speed > 25) { drop_sails(); } could be:

if wind_speed is_greater_than 25
    drop_the_sails()
end if
Loops:

A for loop that iterates through a list of tasks could be:

for_each_hand in crew_list
    give_task(hand)
end for
A while loop that keeps going until a condition is met could be:

while underway
    maintain_course()
    check_engine_room()
end while
This approach allows you to build a language that is not just themed, but where the syntax itself reflects the principles and actions of sailing.

User: what would be a good thing to call my literals, like strings and ints

Response: Based on your nautical theme, here are some good names for literals in your programming language:

Strings
You can call strings hails, signals, or dispatches.

hails: This is a direct, concise term for a communication or a greeting between ships. It's a great fit for a simple string literal like "Ahoy!".

signals: This term is more formal and can represent a message or a set of instructions, like a signal flag message. It works well for longer or more complex strings.

dispatches: This implies a formal, written message, such as a log entry or a report. It's a good name for strings that hold a log of events or a detailed report.

Integers and Decimals
For numbers, you can use terms that represent different units of measurement at sea.

knots: This is the most direct and fitting term for an integer, as it's the standard unit of speed. You could use it to represent any whole number value. For example, knots my_speed = 10;.

bearings: This is a great term for an integer that represents a directional value (0 to 360). You could use it to specify a compass heading.

fathoms: This is a unit of depth equal to six feet. It's an excellent choice for a floating-point number (a number with a decimal). For example, fathoms depth = 25.5;.

cables: This is a unit of length equal to 1/10th of a nautical mile (or about 608 feet). It also works well for decimals.

payload: This can be used for any number that represents a quantity, weight, or size.

Using these terms makes the code more intuitive for someone familiar with nautical concepts. For example, a function to calculate a new course might be set_course(new_bearing). The name of the literal bearing tells you exactly what kind of value is expected.

User: what would be a good thing to call my literals, like strings and ints

Response: Since units like knots and fathoms are already defined, a good non-unit term for integers in your nautical-themed programming language would be tally.

Why tally Works
Tally: In nautical terms, a tally is a count or a log. Sailors would tally the number of barrels loaded, the number of miles sailed, or the number of crew members. It's a verb and a noun that perfectly fits the idea of counting or tracking an integer value.

Context: Using tally as a keyword for an integer makes sense in many programming contexts. For example, tally crew_size = 50; or tally barrels_loaded = 120;. This term is versatile and can be applied to any whole number.

Other options could include:

log: Refers to a ship's logbook, which is used to record events and numerical data. This is another strong contender.

muster: Refers to a count of the crew. This is a great choice if the integer is specifically related to people.

User: what would be a good way to phrase a command to reverse a string

Response: A good way to phrase a command to reverse a string in a nautical-themed programming language would be reverse_hail or back_hail.

Here's why those work and a couple of other options:

reverse_hail is straightforward and uses terms you've already established. It clearly communicates the action (reverse) on the data type (hail, or string). For example, set_course reversed_message = reverse_hail my_hail;.

back_hail is a more evocative term. "To back" a ship means to move it stern-first, which is a good analogy for reversing the order of a string's characters. This adds to the nautical feel of the language.

Other Possibilities
unfurl: If you want to get more poetic, unfurling a sail is a good analogy for revealing something in reverse order. However, it might be less intuitive than reverse_hail.

turn_tail: This is a more informal but very nautical way to describe turning around. It could be a command to reverse the order of items in a list or characters in a string.

User: what would be a good way to specify that input from standard input should be taken?

Response: A good way to specify that input from standard input should be taken in your nautical-themed programming language would be to use a term that means "to receive a message" or "to take a reading."

Commands for Standard Input
receive or receive_signal: This is a direct and intuitive command. It implies that the program is listening for and receiving data. For example, receive hail from_the_bridge; could be used to read a line of text from standard input.

listen: This term is simple and evocative. It suggests the program is waiting for an external source to send it information. For example, listen for_orders;.

take_bearing: This is a more metaphorical option. It implies the program is "taking a reading" from its environment, which in this case is the standard input stream. For example, take_bearing direction; would read a value from the input.

The choice depends on the specific feel you want for your language. receive is the most versatile and direct, while take_bearing is more creative and aligns with the navigation theme.

User: i thought vertrep might work, but receive sounds good

Response: That's an interesting idea, and it shows you're thinking creatively about the theme. VERTREP (Vertical Replenishment) is a solid nautical term, but it might not be the best fit for reading from standard input.

Here’s a breakdown of why, and a deeper look at the other options:

VERTREP refers to a helicopter transferring supplies from one ship to another. It's about taking on a payload, which is similar to receiving data, but it’s a specific, one-time action and doesn't quite capture the idea of a continuous stream of input.

receive is a great choice because it's a general, versatile term for accepting any type of input, whether it's a hail (string), a tally (integer), or a bearing. It implies the program is "listening" for a signal.

listen is also excellent. It evokes a sense of waiting for a command or message to come in. You could use it like listen for_orders, which is very intuitive.

Ultimately, receive and listen are more flexible and directly analogous to what a computer does when it reads from standard input. They feel more like core commands for a language, while VERTREP feels more like a specific function call that would be part of a larger receive process.

User: ok. i am calling strings signals, so i will receive a signal from stdin. print is gonna be 1mc

Response: That's a fantastic idea! Using 1mc for the print command is a perfect fit for a nautical-themed language. The 1MC is the ship-wide public address system on a U.S. Navy vessel, used for broadcasting announcements and orders.

Standard Input
The command to take input from a user would be receive signal. This is clear and concise, and it fits perfectly with your decision to call strings signals.

Example:
To get a user's name, the code could look like this:

1mc "State your name, Seaman."
receive signal crew_name
1mc "Welcome aboard, " + crew_name
Here, the program first broadcasts a message to the user (1mc). Then it receives the user's input (receive signal) and stores it in the crew_name variable before broadcasting another message.

Standard Output
The command to print to standard output would be 1mc. This is a great choice because it's a direct command used to broadcast information. It's instantly recognizable to anyone with knowledge of naval terms.

Example:

1mc "All hands, muster on the main deck!"
This command would print the message "All hands, muster on the main deck!" to the console, just as it would be broadcast over a ship's speakers.

User: what might be a nautical way to add comments to spice up and clarify the code

Response: Adding comments to code is like making a note in a ship's logbook. A good nautical-themed way to do this would be to use terms that evoke the idea of a captain's or navigator's log.

Single-Line Comments
For a single-line comment, a good symbol would be a simple // followed by a nautical term.

// Log:

// Note:

// Ship's Log:

Example:

// Ship's Log: Adjusting course for bad weather.
set_course new_bearing = 270
Multi-Line Comments
For multi-line comments, you can use a more formal term, like logbook or captain's_notes.

/*
Logbook: 
We are plotting a new course to avoid the storm.
The wind is strong, and we are reducing our speed to 10 knots.
*/
set_course new_bearing = 270
set_speed 10
The use of logbook or captain's_notes clearly indicates that the following text is a record or an explanation of the code, much like an entry in a ship's journal.

User: i like it. log is gonna be comment, what would be a good thing to send to stderr

Response: This is a fantastic detail that will make your language feel very authentic. Standard error is where a program sends its warnings, errors, and diagnostic information—the things that went wrong or need attention.

A great nautical term for sending to standard error would be distress.

distress
The term distress immediately communicates that something is wrong. In a nautical context, a distress call (like a "Mayday" signal) is used when a ship is in grave and imminent danger. This is a perfect metaphor for a critical error that requires immediate attention from the programmer.

Example:
To signal an error for a value that is out of bounds, you could write:

// The speed is too high.
if my_speed > max_speed
  distress "Engine overload, reduce throttle immediately."
end if
This command would send the error message "Engine overload, reduce throttle immediately." to the standard error output, much like a ship in trouble would send a distress signal to a receiving station.

Other Options
warning: This is a direct but less thematic term. It's clear and universally understood, but not as evocative as distress.

man overboard: This is a powerful phrase for a critical error, but might be too specific. It works well if the error is related to a missing or invalid input (like a missing variable or file).

running_aground: This is another great option for a critical error. Running aground means the ship has hit the bottom, which is a perfect analogy for a program that has crashed or reached an unrecoverable state.

User: what about concatenating and reversing signals?

Response: That's a great question. You need a way to combine and reverse your "signals" (strings) in your nautical programming language. Here's a look at how you could handle those operations.

Concatenating Signals
For concatenation, you can use a term that signifies joining two things together, like roping two ships.

splice: This is a direct nautical term for joining two ropes by interweaving their strands. It's a perfect metaphor for joining two strings together.

lash: To "lash" means to tie or bind something with rope. It also works well for joining strings.

Using splice would look something like this:

hail crew_greeting = "Ahoy "
hail crew_name = "Skipper"
hail full_greeting = splice(crew_greeting, crew_name)
// full_greeting is now "Ahoy Skipper"
A common programming approach is to use a symbol for concatenation, like the plus sign (+). If you want to keep the nautical theme, a rope-like symbol might be interesting, like & or ~. However, sticking with the verb form like splice is more in line with your command-based language.

Reversing Signals
For reversing signals, you want a term that means turning something around or making it go in the opposite direction.

back_hail: This is a great term because "to back" a ship means to move it backward, which is a perfect analogy for reversing a string.

turn_about: This is a classic nautical phrase for turning a ship around 180 degrees. It's a great option for a more literal reversal command.

Using back_hail would look like this:

hail original_message = "Starboard"
hail reversed_message = back_hail(original_message)
// reversed_message is now "drabratS"
Both splice and back_hail are strong choices because they are both authentic nautical terms and clearly communicate the intended operation.

User: they are signals, not hails

Response: You're absolutely right! My apologies. The commands should use the term signal to remain consistent with your language's terminology.

Here's how those commands would be phrased correctly:

Concatenating Signals
For joining two signals together, you can use splice or lash.

splice is the most fitting nautical term for joining two ropes (or in this case, signals).

Example:

signal crew_greeting = "Ahoy "
signal crew_name = "Skipper"
signal full_greeting = splice(crew_greeting, crew_name)
// full_greeting is now "Ahoy Skipper"
Reversing Signals
For reversing the characters in a signal, the terms back_signal and turn_about work best.

back_signal is a direct and clear command.

turn_about is a classic nautical phrase for a U-turn, which is a great metaphor for reversing something.

Example:

signal original_message = "Starboard"
signal reversed_message = back_signal(original_message)
// reversed_message is now "drabratS"
User: what would be cooler than parenthesis

Response: Since you're creating a nautical-themed language, replacing standard parentheses with symbols that evoke maritime concepts would be a cool and unique choice.

Instead of (), you could use a pair of symbols that look like they're roping something in or marking a point on a chart.

[ ] (Brackets)
Brackets are a good, clean choice that are already used in some programming languages for different purposes. You can give them a new meaning in your language. They look a bit like a ship's berth or a dock, holding the code inside.

Example:
set_course bearing [ 270 ]

&lt; &gt; (Angle Brackets)
Angle brackets can look like a ship's bow and stern, or they could represent the two arms of a sextant taking a bearing. This gives them a very specific, navigational feel.

Example:
set_course bearing < 270 >

| | (Pipes)
Two vertical lines could represent a channel marker or a set of buoys, guiding the program to the right value. This is a simple but effective symbol.

Example:
set_course bearing | 270 |

Of these options, angle brackets (&lt; &gt;) are arguably the "coolest" because they directly resemble navigational tools and feel the most thematically unique.

User: what is an alternative to argumetns

Response: An alternative to using traditional arguments in a function or command is a block.

Blocks are a way to pass a chunk of code to a function that can then be executed at specific times. Instead of defining parameters with a list of variables, the function accepts a block of code and executes it within its scope. This is a powerful feature in languages like Ruby, Smalltalk, and Groovy, and can make code more readable and flexible for certain tasks.

How They Work
With blocks, a function can be designed to perform a task and then, at a certain point, "yield" or "call" the block of code that was passed to it. This allows the function to operate on data and then let the block process the results.

Example in a Nautical Language
In your nautical language, you could use a block to define what happens at each stage of a voyage.

// Here, `voyage_to` is a command that takes a location and a block.
// The block contains the instructions for what to do during the voyage.

voyage_to "Port Royal" [
  // These commands are inside the block
  // They are executed by the `voyage_to` command at the right time.
  1mc "Engines at full."
  maintain_course
]
This makes the code more readable and expressive. The voyage_to command handles the navigation logic, while the block handles the specific actions required for that particular journey. This is a cleaner approach than passing a series of flags or separate functions as arguments.

User: no, what would be an alternative nautical name for an argument

Response: A great alternative nautical name for an argument would be a datum or payload.

Datum
In navigation, a datum is a reference point or a set of known values from which measurements are made. This is an excellent metaphor for an argument, which is a value passed to a function for it to operate on. A function uses its arguments, or "data," to perform its calculations and actions.

Example:
In a command to plot a course, the arguments would be the points of reference.
plot_course < datum start_point, datum end_point >
Here, start_point and end_point are the data points the plot_course function will use.

Payload
A payload is the cargo, passengers, or equipment carried by a vessel. This term works well for arguments because they are the "cargo" that a function "carries" and uses for its work.

Example:
A function that handles transferring items could be called transfer_cargo.
transfer_cargo < payload_tally, payload_signal >
In this example, the payload_tally and payload_signal are the values or "cargo" being passed to the function.
